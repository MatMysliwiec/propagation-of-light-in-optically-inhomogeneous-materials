Introduction and purpose of the work

The geometrical optics approximation is a method for tracing the path of light rays in order to design systems of mirrors, prisms and lenses from uniform optical elements. Over the past few decades, research has been carried out on the propagation of signals in moving media. Contributing to this have been, on the one hand, the applications of electromagnetic systems at increasingly smaller wavelengths and, on the other hand, new optical elements: such as optical fibres and integrated optical elements. The scope of geometrical optics now includes concepts such as optics in large dimensions, geodetic optics and optics of heterogeneous media. The introduction of electromagnetic field theory into this field complements it with effects such as diffraction, acoustic waves and evanescent waves (fading, resulting from reflection at the boundary of media with different refractive indices, which fades expotentially depending on the distance covered). Optical processes have, in turn, introduced some new geometrical theorems and methods that have applications throughout the science of geometrical optics.

The aim of this paper is to present variational issues in optically inhomogeneous media, to derive the propagation equations from the corresponding Hamiltonian principle, furthermore to present the Bogacki-Shampine RK3(2) integration method with an adapted step, which will be used to search for the paths of light rays in optical systems with refractive index dispersion.
